# Chrome Theme Studio ([chrometheme.studio](https://chrometheme.studio))
## Usage
If you'd like to try it out, go to [chrometheme.studio](https://chrometheme.studio) to see a live demo.

## Description & Inspiration
I like to separate my Chrome windows into multiple different profiles (one for work, one for school, one for social media, etc). Each profile has its own distinct color scheme so I can easily identify which profile I'm on.

The Chrome Web Store offers a large selection of themes, but I can often not find the exact theme I'm looking for. I started researching how to create my own themes, but found it was incredibly tedious and required a lot of techincal knowledge (i.e. what RGB colors are, how to create a JSON file, etc).

I wanted to make a Chrome theme generator that could be easily used by anyone to create their own customized themes, without any techincal knowledge. And this is why Chrome Theme Studio was born!
